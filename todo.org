  - [ ] (4) Page 6, paragraph 2: Let $x_{\lambda}$ approximate the
    crossing of the ray arriving at \hat{x} with conv(x_1,…,x_n), and
    let L = L_{\lambda} = \|x-x_{\lambda}\|. Next, we approximate the
    segment of ray $\psi$ contacting x_{\lambda} and \hat{x} with a
    cubic curve \phi:[0,L]\rightarrow \Omega …
  - [ ] (14) A figure similar to mine for 2-pt-update in JMMs.pdf
    would be helpful.
